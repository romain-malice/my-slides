# README

A directory with all my slideshows, in reveal.js.

## Interface

The interface is controlled by the `build.sh` file.

Synthax : `./build.sh FILENAME`

Notes :
- `FILENAME` is the name of the slideshow **without extension**

## Directory Structure

- `slides` contains all the `.md` files that can be edited, 
- `output` contains the `.html` files.
    To launch them, you need the Reveal.js git directory here.
- `images` is the directory where images live
